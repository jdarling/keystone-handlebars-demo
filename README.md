Keystone Demo
=============

This site is an example of a default [Keystone](http://keystonejs.com) application.

Try it out at http://demo.keystonejs.com

It's a great basis to use when starting a Keystone project; just `git clone`
this repository and start making changes.

Pull requests are welcome, or if you'd like to see additional demos just open a
new issue.

Basically forked from the keystone-demo project at https://github.com/JedWatson/keystone-demo then converted some pages to handlebars, the rest are left to the user to convert.
